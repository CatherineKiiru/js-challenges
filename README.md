# Hackerrank Challenges

This is a repository demonstrating JavaScript, React and Node.JS solutions to hackerrank challenges.

## Node.js Process Objects
- This challenge aims to show how to work with the process objects to emit varous events. 
- In our case, the task is to use the process.stdin and process.stdout properties to print the message.
- These two properties work in a similar way to console.log, but with a few differences. 
- In the code, "Welcome to 30 Days of Code" is already hard-coded into the 
inputString parameter as \n,so the main task is to print the
first and second line of output

## Data Types
A data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells the computer how to intepret it's value. JavaScript has 8 data types; String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, undefined, null, symbol and object.
