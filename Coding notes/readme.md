### Queue

In Computer Science, a queue is an abstract data structure where items are kept in order.

New Items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.
Solution in arrays/index.js

### Boolean Values

Boolean values can only be two values: true or false.

### Conditional logic with If Statements

If statements are used to make decisions in code. "If" is a keyword and it tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces depending on the conditions defined within the parentheses. These conditions are known as boolean conditions and they are only true or false.

This means that if the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. If the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute. For example:

```JavaScript
function test (condition) {
    if (condition defined within parentheses is true) {
        //execute the code/return statement within these curly braces
        return "It is true";
    }
    return "It is false";
}
test(true);
test(false);
```
